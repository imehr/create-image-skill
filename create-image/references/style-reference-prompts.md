  - Consistent icon weight and detail level across quadrants
  - Unified color temperature (cool with warm accents)
  - Similar visual density in each quadrant
  - The four quadrants together should communicate: "professional sports training platform"

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Why This Prompt Structure Works:
  1. Explicit negations ("NOT tennis", "NO alleys") - AI models tend to include common similar items unless explicitly told not to
  2. Hex color codes - Gemini can interpret and apply these precisely
  3. Dimensional specifications - Grounds the model's understanding of proportions
  4. Quadrant independence - Each quadrant can be described separately because they serve different purposes in the style vocabulary





  - Rounded terminals on ALL strokes (no sharp endings)
  - Circular bowls (o, p, b, d are perfectly round)
  - Large x-height for easy reading
  - Open letterforms (wide apertures in c, e, a)
  - Chunky, even stroke weight
  - Single-story 'a' and 'g' (easier for kids to recognize)

  Hierarchy Examples to Show:
  - **Display/Hero**: Bold weight (700), large and bouncy, slight letter-spacing (+3%)
  - **Headings**: Semibold weight (600), friendly size, can use fun colors
  - **Body**: Medium weight (500), comfortable for young readers, generous line-height (1.8)
  - **Captions/Labels**: Semibold (600), small but chunky, can be playful colors
  - **Numbers**: Fun, rounded numerals - large and clear

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Typography for Kids - Key Principles:
  1. Single-story letterforms - Letters like 'a' and 'g' should match what kids learn to write (single-story 'a' not double-story)
  2. Large x-height - The height of lowercase letters relative to capitals directly impacts readability for developing readers
  3. Generous line-height (1.7-1.8) - Kids track lines better with more vertical space
  4. Avoid pure red for errors - Soft orange or pink is encouraging; red feels punishing to children

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Would you like me to generate any of these kid-friendly style reference grids, or adjust any elements?

  Gender Representation Summary

  All 4 variants include:
  - Equal male/female athlete representation in every applicable quadrant
  - Athletes shown as equals - same visual prominence, similar poses
  - Diverse body types within athletic range
  - Contemporary, gender-neutral athletic wear
  - Both genders shown in action - not just the male athlete demonstrating while female watches
  - Aspirational but relatable - real young athletes, not models

  ---
  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Designing for 16-18 Year Olds:
  1. Authenticity over polish - This age group detects "corporate trying to be cool" instantly. Reference real culture, not sanitized versions.
  2. Gender representation matters - Equal, authentic representation isn't just ethical—it's expected by Gen-Z. Anything less feels dated.
  3. Social-ready design - If your training materials wouldn't look good screenshotted and shared, they'll feel outdated to this audience.

  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Would you like me to generate any of these style reference grids, or refine specific elements for your young athlete audience?
